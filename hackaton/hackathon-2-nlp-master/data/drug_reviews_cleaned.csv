164952,Phentermine / topiramate,Weight Loss,"""I have been on the Qysmia for 3 weeks now.  I wanted  to wait a few weeks  to give a review. I have a very slow metabolism so I  did not lose as much as some in the first two weeks  upon taking.  My weight started at 198.  I am down to 193. So I  have lost  5 lbs in 3 weeks.  But that  is with  out cardio.  My  appetite  is suppressed.  Dry mouth.  So drink a lot of water. Tingling almost numbness in my feet at times but it goes away shortly after. The  medication  if not covered  or with the free trial  is expensive.  So be prepared.  I guess it  is cheaper  than weight loss surgery.  But it&#039;s no magic pill neither.  Like any other pill  you must eat right and exercise. To lose the weight.  Well that&#039;s  my take anyway.""",8.0,"December 25, 2015",38,3

So contract gave me some stupid contrave card that charge me $60 a month - much more expensive than phentermine but for that price I&#039;d try it. So now after about a year they jacked the price up with no notice right when I went to refill it to $92 no warning no reason and it&#039;s putting my life at risk to have no pills to wean off and no way to pay for the sudden increase.  So whatever you do, I won&#039;t even start this drug even if they pretend they will give you a cut price because they will suddenly increase it after you&#039;re on it hoping you can just pay it to avoid the  consequences of going off of it cold turkey, good luck""",1.0,"November 2, 2016",26,1

The first week was rough: lots of headaches, irritability, with an easily evoked &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. Although I will say that when I was feeling irritable and unreasonably mad, I was well aware of my behavior and knew it was a side effect of the med. I also have underlying mild anxiety/depression which has gotten considerably more challenging on this med. I do take Zoloft 100mg daily. All and all between the weight loss and endorphins from exercising(30 min daily) made it a lot easier to handle. For all of my time on this med, sleeping has been challenging. I have to wait a good 17-18 hrs after taking the med before I can sleep. I tried taking half a pill and it was totally ineffective. I have always been prone to dizzy spells when standing up quickly or squatting and standing: this med intensified that effect big time. But after 4-5 weeks that side effect was much less. Dry mouth is also still very common.I  don&#039;t mind as it encourages me to drink more water! All said and done, it&#039;s been 9 weeks and I&#039;ve gone down 37 lbs with little effort, and I still have zero appetite. I eat because I am supposed to, not because I am hungry. The effectiveness has only decreased around 15-16 hrs after taking the pill. I am 31, starting weight 252.  I am a huge fan of this med. The side effects are manageable and well worth the 37 lbs loss. Diet wise, I&#039;m doing low carb/low fat/low calorie, I go out to dinner 1-3 times a week and drink minimal to no alcohol. I did not have any spikes in blood pressure either. The initial stimulant effect went away quickly, I just feel like my normal self when I take it. The most important part of this med to me, is that it takes away ALL my cravings. Yes it destroys my appetite, but being hungry was never the reason I overindulged in the past. This med makes food indifferent so I use it as I should:as fuel, not for pleasure. Also you will get a prescription for 3 months as it is intended to be a short term medication due to the side effects on your heart(read packet insert for details). If you have high blood pressure you cannot take this :(
