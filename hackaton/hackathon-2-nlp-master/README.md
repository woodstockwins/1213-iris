# Challenge

Have fun and build your skills! ðŸš€

### Goal

Predict `ratings_simplified` using the the `review` column only. If there's time after you have a good model working and hypertuned, you can use the `drugName` and `condition` columns in your model too.

The goal is to make a model that scores well on your 25% of the test (holdout) set, without any data leakage. Use `random_state=123` when you have a random_state option. 

Use different text encoding options and different algorithms. You can make as many models as you like.


### Roles

- Everyone should do the work. One person should share their screen in the group.
- One person from your group will be the spokesperson who will present your results. If you have already done this in a past hackathon, have another person do it. 

## Have fun! ðŸ˜€
